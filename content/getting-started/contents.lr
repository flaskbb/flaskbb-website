# Getting Started

----

We recommend installing FlaskBB in an isolated Python environment. This can be
achieved with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) which we will use in our little installation guide.
In addition to virtualenv, we will also use the package manager [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) 
to install the dependencies for FlaskBB.
